# `shell`
> IMPORTANT: The [documentation](Documentation-shell-abraham-ukachi.pdf) in this repository is a work in progress and subject to major changes soon.

Welcome to my first assignment on **`SHELL`** - a week course / project at [La Plateforme_ IT School](https://laplateforme.io) in September 2022  during which I acquired a lot of knowledge related to shells. Here's a compressed version or list of what was added to my knowledge base :) 
- **Shell**: What is a shell and what are the other types of shells?
- **Bash**: The history of the **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell;
- **man & ls** : Important commands like `man` and `ls` to display manual pages of specific commands and to list the directory contents respectively.
- **chmod** : A utility that changes the user ID and/or group ID of specified files.
